//  Quint Home – Diffuser range
//  Source of truth: "Aroma Diffuser Collection – Product
//  Catalogue 2026" (6 models). Specs, key features, taglines and
//  "best for" tags are transcribed VERBATIM from the catalogue,
//  per-model – do not move values between models.
//
//  NOTE ON PRICING: the catalogue carries no prices. The figures
//  below are the owner's, and listPriceINR is the pre-discount list
//  price shown struck through. Both are only the FALLBACK for when
//  Shopify can't be reached — the store's price and compareAtPrice
//  are what shoppers actually see, so a repricing happens there
//  first and these are brought into line with it.
//
//  IMAGERY: per-product lifestyle photography (5 images each) lives
//  under /images/diffusers/<slug>/. The A326 ships in two finishes,
//  so it carries separate gold + black image sets.

Mode sets how much scent the room gets, at a light, medium or strong setting. Timer sets how long it runs: one, two or four hours, releasing a measured burst every 15, 60 or 120 seconds. In a car it starts and stops with the engine, so it is scenting the cabin by the time you have pulled away.",
